# Module 3 Challenge

### 1. Which of the following statements correctly describe large language models (LLMs)? Select three answers.
- **Answer:**  
  - **LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data.**
  - **LLMs use statistics to analyze the relationships among the words in a sequence.**
  - **LLMs can identify patterns that exist in human language.**

  LLMs are trained on vast datasets to learn the structure of language and the relationships between words. They use statistical methods to identify patterns and generate coherent text, but they are not necessarily trained exclusively on articles from the web.

### 2. A research team uses two different LLMs to generate summaries of published scientific papers. The team notices discrepancies between the summaries that were produced by each LLM. What potential issue with LLM output does this scenario highlight?
- **Answer:**  
  - **Training differences between LLMs can lead to varied output**

  Since different LLMs may have been trained on different datasets or use different underlying architectures, discrepancies in their output are common. This highlights the importance of consistency in model training and architecture.

### 3. Which of the following statements are true of prompting? Select three answers.
- **Answer:**  
  - **Specifying a persona directs an AI tool's focus.**
  - **Prompting is often an iterative process.**
  - **Writing a clear and specific task tends to produce useful outputs.**

  Clear and specific prompts guide the AI to generate more accurate outputs. Specifying a persona helps set the tone or perspective, and prompting is often refined iteratively to improve results.

### 4. A sports podcaster is using an AI tool to compare the current statistics of European football players to their statistics in previous seasons. Which prompt provides the clearest instructions with the most context?
- **Answer:**  
  - **Generate a comparative analysis of key statistics for top European football players in the current season compared to previous seasons. Display the statistics in a data table.**

  This prompt is the most specific and clear, providing detailed instructions about comparing statistics and even specifying the format (data table).

### 5. A graphic artist prompts an AI tool to summarize the latest trends in the design industry. Within the prompt, they provide three examples to demonstrate the context, phrasing, and intended format of the output. What does this scenario describe?
- **Answer:**  
  - **Few-shot prompting**

  Few-shot prompting involves providing a few examples (like three in this case) to help the AI understand the desired output format and context, making it more likely to generate the correct response.
