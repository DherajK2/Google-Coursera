### Question 3:
**Which tracking method is most useful when project managers need a way to track big milestones in a project?**

- **Answer**: **Gantt chart**  
  Gantt charts are excellent for visualizing project milestones and timelines, making it easy to track progress and ensure key milestones are met on schedule.

### Question 4:
**A burndown chart tracks time and amount of remaining tasks. What data is typically represented on the graph's X-axis, the horizontal axis?**

- **Answer**: **Remaining time on the project**  
  The X-axis of a burndown chart typically represents time, and the chart tracks how many tasks or work hours remain to be completed.

### Question 5:
**A software company is hosting a conference for their top executives. When they review the attendee reservations, the actual number of attendees is higher than expected. Which of the triple constraints does this change impact the most?**

- **Answer**: **Budget**  
  A higher-than-expected number of attendees would primarily impact the budget, as more resources (such as space, food, or accommodations) may be needed to accommodate the increased number of people.

---

### Question 6:
**During a project’s execution phase, what type of event does scope creep signify?**

- **Answer**: **Risk**  
  Scope creep is considered a risk because it refers to uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in the project’s scope, which can negatively affect the project’s budget, timeline, and resources.

---

### Question 7:
**What should a project manager do first in order to incorporate dependency management into a project effectively?**

- **Answer**: **Identify all possible dependencies and categorize them**  
  To manage dependencies effectively, the project manager must first identify all dependencies between tasks and categorize them to understand how they might impact the project timeline.

---

### Question 8:
**What tool can project managers use to calculate risk exposure and prioritize risks using high, medium, and low rankings?**

- **Answer**: **Probability and impact matrix**  
  The probability and impact matrix helps project managers assess and prioritize risks by evaluating their likelihood and potential impact on the project.

---

### Question 9:
**What should you do in an escalation email? Select all that apply.**

- **Answer**:  
  - **Explain the problem.**  
  - **Make a request.**

### Question 10:
**What common problems can a project manager avoid by escalating an issue? Select all that apply.**

- **Answer**:  
  - **Bad compromises**  
  - **Trench wars**  
  Escalating issues helps avoid bad compromises (where decisions are made hastily or without full consideration) and trench wars (where team members become entrenched in their positions and conflicts escalate), both of which can stall project progress.

---

### Question 11:
**As a project manager, you’re implementing the ROAM technique for a new risk. You work with stakeholders and team members to formulate a plan to lessen the impact the risk will have on the project. Which ROAM category is this risk now in?**

- **Answer**: **Mitigated**  
  By formulating a plan to lessen the impact of the risk, the risk falls under the **Mitigated** category in the ROAM technique, which involves reducing the likelihood or impact of the risk.
