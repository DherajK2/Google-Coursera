- **Answer**: **Treat risks**  
  Treating risks involves developing a strategy to mitigate or respond to each identified risk.

---

### Question 4:
**Which of the following tools can project managers use to brainstorm the potential causes of risks?**

- **Answer**: **Fishbone diagram**  
  A fishbone diagram (also known as an Ishikawa diagram) helps identify potential causes of risks by visualizing them in categories.

---

### Question 5:
**Fill in the blank: Once an organization has explored the inherent risks of a project, its willingness to accept the possible outcomes of those risks is known as _____.**

- **Answer**: **Risk appetite**

### Question 6:
**A project manager identifies a series of tasks in an upcoming project that can only be started when the previous task has been completed. What term defines the relationship between these tasks?**

- **Answer**: **Dependency**  
  Task dependency describes the relationship where one task must be completed before another can begin.

---

### Question 7:
**What does a risk management plan typically contain? Select all that apply.**

- **Answer**:  
  - **Probability estimates for each risk**  
  - **A mitigation plan for each risk**  

  A risk management plan typically includes the likelihood of each risk occurring and a strategy for mitigating or addressing those risks.

### Question 8:
**Why should project managers communicate risks clearly to stakeholders? Select all that apply.**

### Question 9:
**As a project manager, you’re identifying task dependencies. Task B cannot finish until Task A is complete—the tasks operate at the same time. Which type of dependency does this situation represent?**

- **Answer**: **Finish to Start (FS)**  
  A Finish to Start (FS) dependency means that Task B cannot start until Task A is finished. However, since these tasks operate simultaneously, this is the appropriate dependency for this situation.

---

### Question 10:
**Which of the following best describes the risk register in the risk management plan?**

- **Answer**: **A description of each risk, its risk rating, and a mitigation plan**  
  The risk register includes a detailed list of identified risks, their likelihood and impact, and a mitigation plan for each risk.
