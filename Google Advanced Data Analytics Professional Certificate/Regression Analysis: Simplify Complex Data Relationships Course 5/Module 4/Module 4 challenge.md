# Module 4 challenge


### 1. **Question 1**  
Fill in the blank: The _____ determines whether an observed categorical variable follows an expected distribution.  
- **Answer:** chi-squared goodness of fit test

---

### 2. **Question 2**  
What is the group of statistical techniques that test the difference of means between three or more groups?  
- **Answer:** Analysis of variance

---

### 3. **Question 3**  
A data professional at an online retailer wants to understand the expected outcome of an upcoming sale. They perform a test that compares the means of one continuous dependent variable based on five groups of two categorical variables. What type of test does this scenario describe?  
- **Answer:** Two-way analysis of variance

---

### 4. **Question 4**  
What test performs a pairwise comparison between all available groups while controlling for the error rate?  
- **Answer:** Post hoc test

---

### 5. **Question 5**  
A data analytics team wants to solve a problem about employee retention. They study the relationship between categorical and continuous variables to ensure all variables are relevant to the retention issues. What type of statistical technique do they use?  
- **Answer:** Analysis of variance

---

### 6. **Question 6**  
Fill in the blank: When using _____, the independent variables must be categorical and the outcome variables must be continuous.  
- **Answer:** analysis of variance

---

### 7. **Question 7**  
A data analyst wants to evaluate the effectiveness of different exercise programs on memory and fitness levels in elderly test subjects, controlling for age. She has two continuous dependent variables: memory score and fitness score. Her independent variable is the exercise program, which can be yoga, tai chi, or swimming. What type of test should she use?  
- **Answer:** MANCOVA

---

### 8. **Question 8**  
Which of the following is true about ANOVA testing? Select all that apply.  
- **Answer:**  
  - ANOVA testing is limited in that it doesn’t tell you which group is different. To make such a determination, other tests are necessary.  
  - It is sufficient for only one group’s mean to be significantly different from the others to reject the null hypothesis.  
  - ANOVA works by comparing the variance between each group to the variance within each group. The greater the ratio of variance between groups to variance within groups, the greater the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis.

### 9. **Question 9**  
Fill in the blank: In a Chi-squared goodness of fit test, the ____ there are in the experiment, the greater the probability of getting a given Chi-squared test statistic if the null hypothesis is true.  
- **Answer:** More degrees of freedom

---

### 10. **Question 10**  
What is the primary purpose of a Chi-squared test for independence?  
- **Answer:** To test whether or not two categorical variables are associated with each other
