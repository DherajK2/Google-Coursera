- **Answer:** Residual

---

### 2. **Question 2**  
In linear regression, what mathematical technique is used to calculate the best fit line?  
- **Answer:** Ordinary least squares

---

### 3. **Question 3**  
A data professional testing for linear regression assumptions plots their dependent variable against their independent variable and notices that the graph appears as a repeating waveform. Which model assumption does this invalidate?  
- **Answer:** Linearity

---

### 4. **Question 4**  
Fill in the blank: A scatterplot matrix is a series of scatterplots that show the _____ between pairs of variables.  
- **Answer:** relationships

---

### 5. **Question 5**  
A data analytics professional working for a storage facility checks model assumptions while determining optimal storage space sizes. They notice that the model's residuals appear in a cone-shaped pattern when plotted against the independent variable. Which model assumption does this invalidate?  
- **Answer:** Homoscedasticity

---

### 6. **Question 6**  
Fill in the blank: A confidence band is the area surrounding a line that describes the _____ around the predicted outcome at every value of X.

- **Answer:** R squared

---

### 8. **Question 8**  
Which of the following statements accurately describe running a randomized, controlled experiment? Select all that apply.  
- **Answer:**  
  - It is a study design that randomly assigns participants into groups.  
  - It is typically used when arguing for causation between variables.

### 9. **Question 9**  
What is true about the correlation (r) between altitude and atmospheric pressure?  
- **Answer:** r is negative.

---

### 10. **Question 10**  
The relationship between two continuous variables X and Y can be summarized as follows:  
X: Mean = 0, Standard deviation = 1  
Y: Mean = 2, Standard deviation = 1  
X and Y have a correlation coefficient (r) of 1.

- **Answer:**  
  - (0, 2)  
  - (1, 3)
