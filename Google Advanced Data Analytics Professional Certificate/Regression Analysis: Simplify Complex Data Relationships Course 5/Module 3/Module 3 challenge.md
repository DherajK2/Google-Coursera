- **Answer:** Multiple linear regression

  - Shirt size

### 3. **Question 3**  
Which of the following is true regarding variance inflation factors? Select all that apply.  
- **Answer:**  
  - The larger the variable inflation factor, the more multicollinearity in the model.  
  - The minimum value is 1.

### 4. **Question 4**  
What term represents the relationship for how two variablesâ€™ values affect each other?  
- **Answer:** Interaction term

- **Answer:** Backward elimination

---

### 7. **Question 7**  
A data professional tells you that their model fails to adequately capture the relationship between the target variable and independent variables because it has too much bias. What is the most likely cause of the bias?  
- **Answer:** Underfitting

### 8. **Question 8**  
What regularization technique is recommended when working with large datasets and when there is uncertainty as to whether variables should drop out of the model?  
- **Answer:** Elastic net regression

### 10. **Question 10**  
A national union of shepherds hires a research firm to better understand the relationship between foraging time, temperature, rainfall, and days of sunshine; and the annual wool yield of sheep. The firm sends a researcher to study the largest flock of sheep in the country, gather data, and build a regression model. Which assumption of multiple regression would this model violate?  
- **Answer:** The assumption of independent observations
