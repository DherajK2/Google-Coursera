### 10. **Question 10**  
You have a regression equation in the form of  
\( \hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X \). What is true about this equation? Select all that apply.  
- **Answer:**  
  - For every 1 increase in \( X \), you can expect a \( \hat{\beta}_1 \) increase in \( \hat{y} \).  
  - It is linear.
