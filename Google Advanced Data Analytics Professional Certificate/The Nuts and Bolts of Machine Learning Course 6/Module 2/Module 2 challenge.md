### **Question 1**  
Which of the following statements accurately describe the general categories of feature engineering? Select all that apply.

- **Answer:**
  - The three general categories of feature engineering are selection, extraction, and transformation.
  - Feature transformation involves modifying existing features in a way that improves accuracy when training a model.

### **Question 2**  
A data professional works with a dataset for a project with their company’s human resources team. They discover that the dataset has a predictor variable that contains more instances of one outcome than another. What will occur as a result of this scenario?

- **Answer:** Class imbalance

---

### **Question 3**  
Fill in the blank: Customer churn is a business term that describes how many customers stop _____ and at what rate this occurs.

- **Answer:** Doing business with a company

---

### **Question 4**  
Naive Bayes’s theorem enables data professionals to calculate posterior probability for a data project. What does posterior probability describe?

- **Answer:** The likelihood of an event occurring after taking into consideration all new, relevant observations and information

---

### **Question 5**  
Fill in the blank: When normalizing the columns in a dataset using MinMaxScaler, the columns’ maximum value scales to one, and the minimum value scales to _____ . Everything else falls somewhere in between.

- **Answer:** 0

---

### **Question 6**  
A data professional built a model and is now evaluating the model’s performance and considering how it can be improved. Which PACE stage does this scenario describe?

- **Answer:** Analyze

---

### **Question 7**  
In the model-development process, which type of feature is not useful by itself for predicting the target variable, but becomes predictive in conjunction with other features?

- **Answer:** Interactive

---

### **Question 8**  
Fill in the blank: Log normalization involves reducing _____ in order to make the data more effective for modeling.

- **Answer:** Skew

---

### **Question 9**  
A data professional is predicting user wait times on a new ride-sharing app. They are looking at historical data on millions of rides, but some wait times are very long due to rare events like accidents or bad weather. What can you say about this data and the appropriate evaluation metrics for predicting wait times?

- **Answer:** The data is imbalanced, and precision and recall metrics are useful for evaluating how well the model handles this issue.

### **Question 10**  
You are trying to find the probability of an event, A, given that another event, B is true. Which theorem could you use in this situation?

- **Answer:** Bayes Theorem
