### **Question 1**  
Which of the following statements correctly describe supervised and unsupervised machine learning? Select all that apply.

- **Answer:**
  - Supervised machine learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify or predict outcomes.
  - Data professionals use supervised machine learning for prediction.
  - In unsupervised machine learning, data professionals ask the model to give them information without telling the model what the answer should be.

- **Answer:** Seaborn

---

### **Question 9**  
Fill in the blank: In a typical business, a data professional is most likely to request assistance from the _____ department to obtain preliminary information about a dataset.

- **Answer:** Information technology

### **Question 10**  
A company wants to streamline their hiring process. They want to build a highly advanced machine learning model to help evaluate candidates by analyzing interview videos. The model will analyze facial expressions and body language, as well as vocal intonation and inflection patterns from the audio. They want to use this information to identify candidates who possess qualities that the company deems important. They don’t want to inform the candidates of this process. Why is this ethically problematic? Select all that apply.

- **Answer:**
  - Lack of transparency. It is not ethical to record a candidate and base hiring decisions on the recording without their knowledge of the process.
  - Potential for unreliable assessments. Speech patterns and body language can vary greatly between people and cultures and there’s great risk of misinterpretation.
  - Risk of bias and unfairness. Algorithms can unintentionally discriminate against candidates based on race, gender, age, and other protected characteristics. If the training data was biased, the model will be biased too, perpetuating existing biases and inequalities.
