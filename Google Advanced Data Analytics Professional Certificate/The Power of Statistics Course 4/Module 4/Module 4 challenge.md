# Module 4 challenge

### Question 1:
**What would a data professional use to estimate a population parameter using a range of values?**

- **Answer:** Interval estimate

---

### Question 2:
**A data professional working for a theme park is estimating the mean time visitors spend in the park. They construct the following 95% confidence interval based on a sample mean of 3.5 hours: [2.5, 4.5]. What is the margin of error?**

- **Answer:** +/- 1 hour

---

### Question 3:
**A data professional working for a media company is estimating the average amount of time a visitor spends on their website. Based on a sample mean of 4 minutes, they construct the following 95% confidence interval: [3.8 , 4.2]. What does 95% refer to?**

- **Answer:** The percentage of all possible sample means that fall within the range of the interval

---

### Question 4:
**A data analytics team with a clothing manufacturer constructs a confidence interval to help estimate future returns. First, they identify the sample statistic. Then, they choose a confidence level of 95%. According to the four steps to constructing a confidence interval for a proportion, what should they do next?**

- **Answer:** Find the margin of error

---

### Question 5:
**A data professional working for a light bulb manufacturer is estimating the mean bulb lifespan based on sample data. They construct a 95% confidence interval using a sample size of 100. In addition, they construct a 95% confidence interval using a sample size of 1,000. What happens as the sample size increases?**

- **Answer:** The margin of error decreases.

---

### Question 6:
**In the context of constructing a confidence interval of a population mean, what does the loc argument of the scipy.stats.norm.interval() function refer to?**

- **Answer:** Sample mean

---

### Question 7:
**Fill in the blank: Data professionals use the _____ when working with a small sample size and data that is approximately normally distributed.**

- **Answer:** t-distribution

---

### Question 8:
**Which of the following statements accurately describe the graph of the t-distribution? Select all that apply.**

- **Answer:**
  - As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.
  - It has larger tails than the standard normal distribution.
