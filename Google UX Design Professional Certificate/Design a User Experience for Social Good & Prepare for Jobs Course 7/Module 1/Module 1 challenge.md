7. **Question:** You are giving a presentation to individuals who potentially want to pursue a career in UX design. You make the statement that UX designers have to plan for a nearly endless number of different devices and different variables, such as varying screen sizes and different input methods like a keyboard or microphone. A participant asks you why this is true. How would you respond?

   **Answer:**  
   - Regardless of the type of device users prefer, their experience across any and all devices should be consistent. When it comes to design, UX designers need to keep this notion front of mind.  
   - Users are likely to look at the same website across devices—on their mobile phones, tablets, laptops, or TVs.  
   - The number of devices available to experience content on is constantly growing and changing.  
   - Users have different preferences and different abilities as far as technological knowledge. This means UX designers have to plan for both high and low aptitude users.

9. **Question:** In your UX design class, the instructor is talking about using the 4 Cs when designing across devices. They give the example of a person who has an email app on both their mobile phone and smartwatch. The person is likely not going to compose emails on their smartwatch. Rather, they might want to receive email notifications or see important messages on their smartwatch. The instructor reinforces this example by saying that UX designers must design for the needs of a specific device and the way in which the user will use that device in any given situation. Which of the 4 Cs does this address?

   **Answer:**  
   - Context
