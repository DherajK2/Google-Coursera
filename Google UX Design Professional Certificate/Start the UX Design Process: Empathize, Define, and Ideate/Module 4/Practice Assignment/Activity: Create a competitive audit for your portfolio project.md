# Activity: Create a Competitive Audit for Your Portfolio Project

## Question 1  
**Briefly describe one or two key wins you had as you completed this self review. Key wins can be lessons you learned, takeaways you gleaned, successes you achieved, and so on.**

**Answer:**  
One key win during this self-review was realizing how important it is to clearly categorize competitors as "direct" or "indirect." This distinction helped me focus on the most relevant competitors and understand their strategies better. Another win was identifying gaps in the market, which gave me insight into potential opportunities for innovation and improvement in the product I'm working on. By closely analyzing competitors' strengths and weaknesses, I was able to pinpoint areas where my project could offer unique value.
