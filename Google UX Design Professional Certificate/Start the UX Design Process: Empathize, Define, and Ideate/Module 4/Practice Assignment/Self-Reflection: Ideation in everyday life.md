# Self-Reflection: Ideation in Everyday Life

## Question 1  
**Describe an example of a time you used the ideation process in the real world. If you canâ€™t think of an example, think of a project where the ideation process could have been useful. Reflect on the steps you took. How did the process benefit the projects you worked on? What were the drawbacks?**

**Answer:**  
In a recent project, I used the ideation process to redesign a website for a local bakery. The process started with brainstorming various ideas for improving navigation and user experience. We created sketches and wireframes, then collaborated as a team to refine the concepts. This helped identify the most effective solutions, leading to a cleaner and more user-friendly site.

The ideation process benefited the project by encouraging creative thinking and allowing us to explore multiple solutions. However, a drawback was that it initially led to too many ideas, making it harder to focus on the most feasible ones.
