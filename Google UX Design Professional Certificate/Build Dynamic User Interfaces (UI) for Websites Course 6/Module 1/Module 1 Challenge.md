### Question 4  
**You are in the wireframing stage for an app you are designing. What should be included in your wireframes?**

- **Answer:**  
  - Simple shapes  

  **Explanation:** Wireframes are basic outlines that use simple shapes to represent content and navigation, focusing on structure and layout rather than design elements like stock photos or icons.

### Question 7  
**A friend, who is not a designer, asks you why you are spending time on wireframes. What might you tell them?**

- **Answer:**  
  - Wireframes are inexpensive and allow for lots of iterations.  

  **Explanation:** Wireframes are quick, low-cost prototypes that allow for easy changes and iterations in the early stages of design, helping to refine user experience before moving to more detailed designs.

### Question 8  
**Which features are important to include in your wireframes to ensure that people using assistive technology have a great user experience? Select all that apply.**

- **Answer:**  
  - Initial focus  
  - Landmarks  
  - Headings  

  **Explanation:** Features like proper focus order, landmarks for easy navigation, and clear headings help users with assistive technology to better understand and interact with the app or website.

### Question 9  
**You are designing an app for pet care. You have used the same shapes in your wireframes to denote cats (diamonds), dogs (stars), and rabbits (ovals). Which Gestalt Principle have you used?**

- **Answer:**  
  - Similarity  

  **Explanation:** The Gestalt principle of similarity suggests that elements that are visually similar are perceived as part of a group. By using the same shapes for different animals, you're grouping them based on the visual similarity of the shapes.
