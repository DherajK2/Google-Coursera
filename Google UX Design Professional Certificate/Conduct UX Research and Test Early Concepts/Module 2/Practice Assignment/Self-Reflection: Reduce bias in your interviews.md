# Self-Reflection: Reduce bias in your interviews


## Question 1
Now that you've learned how bias can affect usability study interviews, think about your own interview techniques and answer the following questions:

### What are some steps you can take to increase awareness of your personal biases?

**Answer:**  
- Regularly engage in self-reflection to identify my own biases and assumptions.
- Stay informed about common biases, such as implicit bias or friendliness bias, and how they can affect my research.
- Seek feedback from colleagues or mentors about my approach to ensure that I am not unintentionally influencing the study outcomes.
- Practice mindfulness and remain open to feedback from participants to avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes or personal experiences.

### What can you do to reduce biases when you conduct interviews for a usability study?

**Answer:**  
- Use neutral language and avoid leading questions during interviews to prevent influencing the participantâ€™s responses.
- Ensure that all participants are treated equally and that no group is favored or overlooked based on personal biases.
- Use a structured interview guide with predetermined questions to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of bias in questioning.
- Foster an environment of openness and trust where participants feel comfortable sharing honest feedback.
- Consider using multiple interviewers to ensure diverse perspectives and reduce individual biases in interpreting results.
