# Self-Reflection: Your Own Biases

## Question 1
**Implicit bias is a collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge. Take a moment to recognize your own implicit biases.**

- Do you have a positive or negative association with people who live in a particular city?
- Do you have positive or negative assumptions about a particular gender role?
- How have these biases influenced your own design work, your interactions with everyday products, or the people you talk to every day?

### Answer:
- **Bias regarding a particular city**:  
  You might consider whether you have any preconceived ideas (positive or negative) about people who live in a certain city or region. For example, do you associate certain stereotypes with people from a big city versus a rural area? These biases could shape how you approach user experience (UX) or design, particularly in understanding cultural norms, values, and needs for people in different locations.

- **Bias regarding gender roles**:  
  Reflect on whether you unconsciously associate certain roles, behaviors, or responsibilities with a specific gender (e.g., thinking of women as caregivers or men as leaders). These assumptions can show up in your design work when considering product features, tone of voice in branding, or user flows that cater to or reinforce traditional gender roles.

- **Influence on design work**:  
  These biases might affect your design decisions in subtle ways, such as the choice of images, language, user personas, or color schemes. For instance, if you have a bias towards a particular demographic group, you might unintentionally create designs that resonate more with that group while excluding others.

This kind of reflection is an important part of the design process because being aware of your biases helps ensure more inclusive and diverse design solutions.
