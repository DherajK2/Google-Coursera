# Self-Reflection: User Flow

## Question 1  
**Take a moment to reflect on the user flow for an app you use frequently.**

**Answer:**  
The app I use frequently is [App Name] (e.g., Instagram).

- **Main User Flow:**  
  I start by opening the app, where Iâ€™m taken directly to my home feed. From there, I scroll through posts. If I see something I like, I can either "like" it, leave a comment, or share it. If I want to post a photo or video, I tap the "+" icon, which takes me to my gallery to select content. After editing, I can add a caption and share it to my feed.

- **Starting Screen:**  
  I start on the home feed screen, where the latest posts from accounts I follow are displayed.

- **Actions Taken:**  
  - Scrolling through the feed.
  - Liking or commenting on posts.
  - Sharing content.
  - Posting a photo or video.
  - Searching for new accounts or content through the explore tab.

- **Decisions Made Along the Way:**  
  - Whether to interact with a post or scroll past it.
  - Whether to share or save a post.
  - Choosing the content I want to share and editing it.
  - Deciding on captions and hashtags for my post.
