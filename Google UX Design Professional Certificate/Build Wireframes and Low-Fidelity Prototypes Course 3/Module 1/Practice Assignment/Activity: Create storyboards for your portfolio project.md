# Activity: Create Storyboards for Your Portfolio Project

## Question 1  
**Answer:**  
One win I had while creating my storyboard was realizing how effective it is to visually map out the user's journey. It helped me better understand the flow and anticipate potential pain points in the user experience. Another win was improving my ability to think critically about the sequence of events, ensuring each scene logically led to the next, which made the overall narrative much clearer and more impactful.
