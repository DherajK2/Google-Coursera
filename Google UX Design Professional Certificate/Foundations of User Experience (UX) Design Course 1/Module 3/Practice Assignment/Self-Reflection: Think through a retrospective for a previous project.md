# Self-Reflection: Think through a Retrospective for a Previous Project

### Project/Activity: Group Presentation for a Class

- **What did you plan to do together?**  
  We planned to create a presentation on sustainable design practices for a class.

- **What went well?**  
  We divided tasks well, met deadlines, and got positive feedback on our slides.

- **What could have been improved?**  
  We didn’t practice enough, and some content overlapped during the presentation.

- **What would you do differently next time?**  
  I’d practice more and ensure better coordination to avoid repetition.
