# Module 1 challenge: Automation in the Cloud



1. **Question 1**  
What are some advantages of having servers in multiple locations? Select all that apply.  
- [x] Redundancy  
- [x] So you can choose a server near its dependencies  
- [x] To cut down on latency  
- [x] To quickly change the scale of your service  

2. **Question 2**  
Which word best describes the direction you are scaling when increasing the capacity of a specific service by making the nodes bigger?  
- [x] Up  
- [ ] Down  
- [ ] Horizontal  
- [ ] Vertical  

3. **Question 3**  
You work for a company that is moving to a new office. The organization does not use a cloud service. What might you point out to convince them to migrate some services to the cloud during the move?  
- [ ] You won’t have to change your servers’ core configurations.  
- [x] Migrating to the cloud means they won’t have to rush to move servers during a maintenance window.  
- [ ] You don’t have to lose any control you have over your computing services.  
- [ ] You won’t have to move a server from one location to another.  

4. **Question 4**  
Both hybrid clouds and multiclouds use a mix of different cloud services. What is the key difference between a hybrid cloud and a multicloud?  
- [ ] A hybrid cloud runs only on privately owned servers and a multicloud is offered to the public.  
- [x] A hybrid cloud is a mixture of both public and private clouds and a multicloud runs on a mix of different vendors.  
- [ ] A hybrid cloud automatically integrates everything.  
- [ ] A hybrid cloud is offered to the public and a multicloud runs only on privately owned servers.  

5. **Question 5**  
You are about to create a VM to run in the cloud. What are some parameters you can be sure you will need to set? Select all that apply.  
- [ ] The container  
- [x] Region and zone where the instance is running  
- [x] The machine type for your VM  
- [x] Name  

6. **Question 6**  
You’ve set up a VM, modified its configuration settings, and made sure that it's working correctly. Now you want to reproduce this exactly on multiple other machines. How might a template help?  
- [x] By creating a file with all of your system configurations.  
- [ ] By packaging applications together with their configuration.  
- [ ] By managing and automating server configurations.  
- [x] By copying the contents of your virtual machine stored in a reusable format.  

7. **Question 7**  
Why are there usually multiple entry points for a single website? Select all that apply.  
- [ ] To retrieve an IP address for the website the user wants to visit  
- [x] The service can stay up even if one entry point fails.  
- [x] To allow for an entry point that's closer to the user to reduce latency  
- [ ] To create separate storage resources to hold data  

8. **Question 8**  
What is the name for the automated configuration and coordination of complex IT systems and services?  
- [ ] Auto-scaling  
- [x] Orchestration  
- [ ] Templating  
- [ ] Automation  

9. **Question 9**  
You’re looking at factors that influence the performance of a storage solution. One of the big ones is throughput. What is the best definition of throughput?  
- [x] The amount of data that you can read and write in a given amount of time  
- [ ] How many reads or writes you can do in one second, no matter how much data you're accessing  
- [ ] The time it takes a storage system to start delivering data after a read request has been made  
- [ ] The amount of time it takes for a write operation to complete  

10. **Question 10**  
What is read latency?  
- [ ] The amount of data that you can read and write in a given amount of time  
- [ ] How many reads or writes you can do in one second, no matter how much data you're accessing  
- [x] The time it takes a storage system to start delivering data after a read request has been made  
- [ ] The amount of time it takes for a write operation to complete  

11. **Question 11**  
You are planning some improvements in your cloud services, but you want to make the changes in a controlled way. This approach is commonly called “change management”. In change management, how does a continuous integration system, or CI, help to catch problems before they're merged into the main branch?  
- [ ] To create and manage a file system on top of block storage.  
- [x] To build and test code every time there's a change.  
- [ ] To set up a server as a dedicated load balancer.  
- [ ] To automatically deploy the results of a build based on a set of rules.
