# Module 4 challenge: Debug and solve software problems

### Question 1:
**In the start_date_report.py script, what corrections are needed to fix the TypeError encountered during execution? Select all that apply.**

- Cast hour input to integer
- Cast day input to integer
- Cast year input to integer
- Cast month input to integer

---

### Question 2:
**What type of error caused the start_date_report.py script to crash?**

- TypeError

---

### Question 3:
**Finish this sentence: In the lab, to isolate and understand the conditions that caused the error, you _____ .**

- Systematically reproduced the TypeError by running the script with various inputs.

---

### Question 4:
**In the context of the lab, which of the following is a key indicator that a script has been successfully optimized?**

- Reduced execution time to a few seconds for report generation.

---

### Question 5:
**Which of the following best describes the error handling improvement needed in the start_date_report.py script?**

- Casting the user input values for year, month, and day to integers to prevent TypeError.

---

### Question 6:
**After you debugged the original error and fixed it, you discover that processing the file to print a report takes a long time. How do you fix this issue?**

- Nothing. Speed is dependent on the size of the dataset.

---

### Question 7:
**How does preprocessing the file in the start_date_report.py script specifically address the problem of slow report generation?**

- It organizes data by start dates for efficient access, reducing the need for repetitive calculations.

---

### Question 8:
**What key principle should guide your approach to debugging complex problems, as exemplified in the lab's challenges with the start_date_report.py script?**

- Systematically analyze and resolve individual components of the problem to avoid being overwhelmed.

---

### Question 9:
**In the optimization process of the start_date_report.py script, why is creating a dictionary with start dates as keys an effective strategy?**

- It allows for rapid data retrieval without repeatedly scanning the entire dataset.

---

### Question 10:
**In the lab, the get_same_or_newer() function in the start_date_report.py script was originally inefficient because it did which of the following?**

- It downloaded and processed the entire data file for each date queried, leading to excessive and repetitive data handling.
